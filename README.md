# Note-Taker
Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description

This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

This application has a db.json file on the back end that is used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module. Each note has a unique id when it's saved, using the uniqid npm package.

This application has a delete request functionality. All the notes are read from the db.json file, the note with the given id property is removed, and the notes are rewritten to the db.json file.
